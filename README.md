This is a simple Arduino program to measure temperature and humidity and send it to an MQTT server.

I tested it with an ESP32 board and a temperature and humidity sensor (tested with the DHT-22).

To use it, copy the `arduino_secrets.h.example` to `arduino_secrets.h` and fill in your wifi SSID and password.
